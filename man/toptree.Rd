\usage{
toptree(projectDir = "~", missionName = "autoflightcontrol",
  missionTrackList = NULL, launchPos = NULL, demFn = NULL,
  flightAltitude = 100, aboveTreeAlt = 20, presetFlightTask = "remote",
  maxSpeed = 20, followSurfaceRes = 10, altFilter = 1, maxFL = 10,
  batteryTime = 20, windCondition = 1, rcRange = -9999,
  launchAltitude = -9999, uavType = "djip3")
}
\arguments{
\item{projectDir}{path to the main folder where several projects can be hosted
It will overwrite the DEM based estimation if any other value than -9999}

\item{missionName}{base string for mission filenames}

\item{demFn}{filname of the corresponding DEM data file}

\item{flightAltitude}{set the default flight altitude of the mission. It is 
  assumed that the UAV is started at the highest point of the surveyArea 
  otherwise you have to defined the position of launching.
By default it is set to (\code{= 0.0}). If set to \code{-99} it will be 
calculated from the swath width of the pictures. NOTE This makes only sense for 
\code{followingTerrain = TRUE} to smooth curves.
For \code{flightPlanMode = "waypoint"} camera actions are DISABLED during curve flights.}

\item{presetFlightTask}{(DJI only) strongly recommended to use "remote" 
       \cr
 Options are: 
\code{"simple_ortho"} takes one picture/waypoint, 
\code{"multi_ortho"} takes 4 picture at a waypoint, two vertically down and two in forward and backward viewing direction and an angele of -60deg,
\code{"simple_pano"} takes a 360 deg panorama picture and 
\code{"remote"} which assumes that the camera is controlled by the remote control (RC)}

\item{maxSpeed}{cruising speed}

\item{followSurfaceRes}{horizontal step distance for analysing the DEM altitudes}

\item{batteryTime}{estimated life time of battery}

\item{windCondition}{1= calm 2= light air 1-5km/h, 3= light breeze 6-11km/h, 4=gentle breeze 12-19km/h 5= moderate breeze 20-28km/h}

\item{rcRange}{range of estimated range of remote control}

\item{uavType}{type of uav. currently "djip3" and "solo" are supported}

\item{followSurface}{\code{boolean}  TRUE performs an altitude correction 
of the missions flight altitude using additional DEM data. 
If no DEM data is provided and \code{followSurface} is TRUE, 
SRTM data will be downloaded and used
Further explanation at \link{seealso}}

\item{rotationdir}{(DJI only) camera control parameter set the UAV basic turn direction to right (0) or left (1)}

\item{gimbalmode}{(DJI only) camera control parameter
\code{0} deactivates the gimbal control
\code{1} activates the gimbale for focussing POIs
\code{2} activates the gimbale for focus and interpolate a field of view in an angel of \code{gimbalpitchangle}}

\item{gimbalpitchangle}{(DJI only) vertical angle of camera  \code{+30 deg..-90 deg}}

\item{actiontype}{(DJI only) individual actionype settings of the camera c(1,1,...)}

\item{actionparam}{(DJI only) corresponding parameter for the above individual actiontype c(0,0,...)}

\item{batteryTime}{user defined estimation of the lipo lifetime (20 min default)}

\item{maxFl}{maximum duration of a flight in minutes}

\description{
toptree helps to take close up top down pictures from point objects
}
\note{
basic idea is to fly in a serie to object positions with respect to the surface model for taking high resolution pics
