\description{
The basic idea is to provide an easy to use workflow for controlling rtf UAVs from planning and flying autonoumous surveys to derivation and postclassification of the data. 
  makeFP (Make Uav Remote Controlled Survey) creates either intermediate flight control files for the dji phantom x UAVs or ready to upload control files for the 3DR Solo. 
  The dji control files are designed for using with the propietary litchi flight control app exchange format, while the 3DR Solo files are using the MAVLINK common message set, that is used by the PixHawk flight controller family. Both are implemented very rudimentary.\cr\cr
  DJI:\cr
  The reason using DJI is their absolute straightforward usage. Everybody can fly with a DJI but the price ist a hermetically closed system. Only the  litchi app provides additionally to a cloud based mission planer an offline/standalone interface to upload a csv formated waypoint file for autonomous flights to the Phantom.\cr\cr
  PixHawk/3DR Solo:\cr
  The open uav community is focussed on the PixHawk autopilot unit and the Mission Planner software. It is well documented and serveral APIs are provided. Nevertheless a terrain following autonomous flight planning tool is not available. makeFP creates static implementation of the MAV format that is ready to be uploaded directly on the Pixhawk controller using the upload2Solo function.\cr\cr

\note{
To use the script you need to install quite a lot of R-packages and at least the binary GDAL tools as well as SAGA GIS and GRASS GIS according to your system needs. Please find more information at NASA EarthData project: \href{http://giswerk.org/doku.php?id=projekte:micrors:intro}{Micro Remote Sensing at geowerk.org}.\cr
Perfect for a more convenient start is the ease of using such a great package like\code{\link{fgui}} )see examples).
}
\section{Warning}{

 Take care! There are still a lot of construction zones around. This script is far beyond to be in a mature state. 
 Please control and backup all controls again while planning and performing autonomous flight plans and missions.
 You will have a lot of chances to make a small mistake what may yield in a damage of your uav 
 or even worse in involving people, animals or non-cash assets. Check your risk use parachute systems and even if it is running like a charm keep alert!
}

\section{Basic Introduction}{
 
\subsection{Survey Area}{

  To define a flight area you have to provide either 4 Points (or 3 lines). 
  You may take more complex vectors like a multi point polygon,
  but only the first 4 coordinates x1, x2, x3 and x4 (for the launching position) 
  are used in exactly this order. 
  If you take a rectangle the 4th corner coordinate will be the launching point!
  \cr\cr
  The concept is looking like the following sketch.
 \preformatted{ 
  x2------x3           x2-------x1
  | a                 /
  |                  /
  |   x4            / x4    
  |  /             / /
  x1/             x3/
  }
  This coordinates the length of the line and the angle are used to calculate extend and paralells 
  of the flightplan according to the flight altitude, overlap etc. Note the flight direction depends on 
  the order of the points. If the \code{flightPlanMode} is equal \code{tracks}.
  \cr\cr
  The result look like this.
  
 \preformatted{ 
 
  #--#  #-->             #--#  #
  |  |  |               /  /  /
  |  |  |              /  /  /
  |  |  |             /  /  / 
  #  #--#         <--#  #--#
  }
 If \code{flightPlanMode} is equal \code{waypoints} the result is an equal spatial distribution of waypoints:
 \preformatted{ 
 
  #--#  #-->             #--#  #
  |  |  |               /  /  /
  #  #  #              #  #  #
  |  |  |             /  /  / 
  #  #--#         <--#  #--#
  
  }
  
 
  \code{waypoints} is optimal for autonoumous flights under calm conditions in complex terrain 
  because the camara takes a picture at every waypoint\cr
  \code{track} is optimal for relatively plain areas and automatically triggered picture capturing
  Note: Automatically picture capturing in a time interval works only within the range of the remote control. 
  because the the uav needs a trigger signal for taking pictures.
  }
  \subsection{Terrain Following flightplan}{
  
  The \code{followSurface} switch is used to adapt the fixed flight altitude into a terrain following flight altitude.\cr 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\cr
  NOTE: You have to be aware that the DJI uav is calibrating the altitude at the launch position in the field!
  So you need either a correct coordinate altitude or a high resolution DEM to get a good! estimation of the lauch position and altitude. 
  You must choose a clearly defined and reliable launching position both in the map and the field. If you fail I made the experience that the aircraft 
  probably will hit the terrain...\cr
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\cr\cr

 How it works. Let us assume a defined flightaltitude of 50 m. 
 According to the launching point altitude the uav will act like the following sketch shows:
  
\preformatted{ 
                     
  ............... x_(uav)_x ........... uav started at 30 m altitude results in 
                                           a "real" flight altitude of 30m + 50m => 80m
  
  
                  ___60m____
                 |          | 
         30m _x__|          | 
        ____|               |___  
    ___|                        |____ 
 
  
                 ___60m____
      ..........|          |............ uav started at 0 m altitude results in 
             ___|          |___          "real" flight altitude of 50m above 0m
        ____|                  |  
    ___|                       |__x__ 0m
  }  
 To avoid negative impacts from the P3 auto calibration, the launch altitude is used to
 correct the flight altitude according to: \cr
 maximumAltitude_of_surveyArea + altitude_of_launchposition\cr
 So the adapted flight altitude is always seen as the flight altitude above the highest terrain altitude:
  \preformatted{
                 
 ...................................... real altitude of uav 110 m
         

                 ___60m____ 
                |          |
         30m _x_|          |___
        ____|                  |  
    ___|                       |______ 
  }  
 To get a fixed scale flight the launch altitude is used to correct the flight altitude according to   maximumAltitude of surveyArea + altitude of launchposition. With the setting auf terrainfoollowing = true tis is calculated for each waypoint.  . So the adapted flight altitude looks like:
  \preformatted{
                 
                 ..........
                |          |
            ....|          |.... 
       ....|     ___60m____    |    
  ....|         |          |   |....... real altitude of uav 50m
         30m _x_|          |___
        ____|                  |  
    ___|                       |___x___ 0m
  }  
  }
}
