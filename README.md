## robubu
the rolling burning bus -  whatever, it runs fine for now

robubu is a collection of functions, which have arisen from everyday scientific curiosity. Most of it is pretty hybrid integrating GRASS, SAGA, JS tools or other stuff in the R biotope.

Maybe it is useful but at least it runs fine for now ...
